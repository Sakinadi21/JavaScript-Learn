## 💻 How to Use

Open your preferred code editor (VS Code, Sublime, WebStorm) and follow one of these approaches:

### 💡 Option 1: Browser Testing

- Open any `.html` file in `src/` to view results in your browser.
- Use `<script>` tags to link `.js` files and test JavaScript.

### 💡 Option 2: Node.js Runtime

If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed:

```bash
cd src
node functionExample.js
````

Run individual examples directly from the terminal.

## 🧩 Sample Code Snippet

```javascript
// basics/fibonacci.js
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(`Fibonacci(${i}) = ${fibonacci(i)}`);
}
```
