Sync in JS

Synchronous 
Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in this problem.
Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to co,mplete its execution.


Asynchronous
Due to synchronous programming , something imp instructions get blocked due to some previous
instructions, which causes a delay in the UI . Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next 
instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.
